# TeluskoJavaTutorial
This repository contains my solutions to the various assignments from Telusko's Java Tutorial on YouTube.

I would highly recommend anyone who is thinking about learning Java to watch his tutorial on YouTube, which I have linked below. Tekusko explains Java programming concepts and syntax very well, so that viewers are able to absorb and understand his content regardless of their previous programming experience or knowledge.
